# Thmanyah Streaming CMS - Service

This directory contains the core backend service for the Thmanyah Streaming CMS. It is a [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) application responsible for managing all CMS data, including programs, episodes, categories, users, and media assets.

## Architecture

The service is built with a modular architecture, separating concerns into three main layers:

-   `Core`: Handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication (`auth`), database configuration (`database`), caching (`cache`), application configuration (`config`), and object storage (`s3`).
-   `CMS`: Contains the primary business logic for managing CMS entities. Each entity (e.g., `programs`, `episodes`, `categories`) has its own dedicated module.
-   `Discovery`: Implements features related to content discovery, such as search functionality.

## Getting Started

Instructions for running this service are part of the main project documentation. Please refer to the root `README.md` for detailed steps on running the service either with Docker or locally.

### Scripts

### Environment Variables

The service requires a set of environment variables to run correctly. These are defined in `src/.env.example`. For local development, create a `.env` file in the `src` directory and populate it with the necessary values.

```bash
# From the project root
cp services/src/.env.example services/src/.env
```
